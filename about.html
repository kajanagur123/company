        <h2>Co-Founder</h2>
        <p class="text-1">Hello, my name is Kaja Nagur.
            I am a Frontend Java Developer and currently a 2nd-year BE student specializing in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) at GRT Institute of Engineering and Technology (GRTIET).
            
            My skills include:
            
            HTML
            CSS
            JavaScript
            Java
            C
            Bootstrap
            Some of my personal projects include:
            
            A personal website
            A calculator
            Solving 20 problems on HackerRank
            In terms of hobbies, I enjoy watching and playing cricket. However, I don't particularly like watching movies or TV shows.
            
            Although I don’t have many friends in college, I am fortunate to have one true friend who is my best companion.
            One of my dreams is to fulfill a promise I made to my friend — to start a business together and help him achieve his dream of owning his dream car/</p>
